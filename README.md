# Deploying a Node JS and Express REST API using Docker and Digital Ocean | Tutorial and Sample Code

You can view this tutorial at my [**Youtube Channel**](https://youtube.com).

In this repository you will find the code for a simple REST API built using Node JS and Express along with the Dockerfile for containerizing the API. 

## What will you learn?

- Build and Push Docker container images to Docker Hub
- Create Droplets on Digital Ocean
- Use SSH keys to access a Digital Ocean Droplet
- Pull and run Docker image on your Droplet 
- Map a domain to your Digital Ocean Droplet  
- Test your containerized REST API using Postman and Browser

Build Docker Image with username and tag 
Login to Docker on CLI 
docker push
Login to Digital Ocean 
Create SSH Key for Digital Ocean 
Add SSH Key to Digital Ocean 
Create Digital Ocean Droplet with Docker from Marketplace 
Check Docker Version 
Connect to DO Console (or) SSH from CLI 
Docker Run 
Test API in Browser and Postman
